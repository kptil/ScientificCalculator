# Scientific Calculator

## Description

This implementation of a simple scientific calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and finds logarithms using the change of base formula. It also displays the average of all the calculations performed so far. The user selects the operation from a menu and then enters the first and second operands.
